# Jeopardy
Command line single-player jeopardy game built using node.js with mongoose as the database. Questions pulled from j-archive. Scraper may be slightly out-of-date.
For a working multiplayer version go to https://secret-ocean-04091.herokuapp.com/.

## Playing
Run **node play.js**
It may take a little while to boot up, but then you can play through single, double and final jeopardy.

## Scraping
Content is pulled from https://j-archive.com/, a fan-created repository of jeopardy questions, and has questions from season 35.

## Todos
Most current work is being done on the multiplayer jeopardy app, here - https://github.com/noah-rush/Jeopardy-Online. But I would like to add more flexible correct answer logic.
